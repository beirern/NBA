# NBA

## I don't get it
This is when I really liked NBA stats. 

## What's in Here

### Win Shares Corrolation
Used R and a Kaggle dataset of every player's stats since 1950 to find the stats that corrolated highest with Win Shares.
This really was me just learning how to use R outside of class. I learned I hate R.

### College to NBA Stats (Defunct)
Using R, Kaggle, and my own dataset to see what stats translate from College to NBA. I have not touched this and pretty much nothing was even done. Keeping it here in case I ever do anything with it.

### Lebron Stats (Defunct)
I scraped every game from Lebron's career from basketball-reference using Scrapy (python). I was going to do some analysis to see what changed over time in his career and how his stats changed within the season but I never did get to it. Like the project above, I don't know if I will look at this or use this dataset. MJ is the GOAT.
